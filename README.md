For my COVID-19 Data Analysis project, I aim to explore the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing extensive data on deaths, cases, and various key health metrics. Using a dataset with approximately 430,000 rows and a 90MB file size, my goal is to examine trends, patterns, and correlations in COVID-19 data, identifying factors that may have influenced the severity of outbreaks in different regions. 

The analysis is conducted using SQL to handle complex queries and extract actionable insights, complemented by visualizations for a clear and concise presentation of findings. Through this project, I strive to understand the pandemic's progression and help uncover lessons that could support future preparedness efforts. 

Key areas of focus include:
- Time series analysis to track the progression of cases and deaths.
- Comparative analysis across regions to reveal high-risk areas.
- Mortality rate trends and correlations with demographic or health factors.

This project is a comprehensive exploration of the pandemic's data, revealing insights into its impacts and potentially guiding future healthcare responses.
